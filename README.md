# Main web site of [directdemocracy.vote](https://directdemocracy.vote)

This repository holds the main web site of [directdemocracy.vote](https://directdemocracy.vote) in the [httpd](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/tree/master/httpdocs) folder.
This web site contain only static HTML code (including images, css, js, etc.) without any server side code (php, etc.).
Its purpose is to inform about directdemocracy.vote and foster people to participate as citizens, authors, hosts, trusters, stations and/or publishers.

A [framework7](httpdocs/f7.html) version of the directdemocracy client interface is under development, so that an app could be created for mobile phone instead of using the desktop web interface.

The main web site also contains the reference specification for the directdemocracy publications in the [json-schema](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/tree/master/httpdocs/json-schema) folder.
