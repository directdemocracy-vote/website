    "about-text": "The <em>DirectDemocracy Association</em> is a non-profit association based in Switzerland which promotes the <em>directdemocracy</em> electronic voting system to enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.",
    "motivation": "<b>Our Motivation:</b> Humanity is facing increasingly challenging threats: global warming, mass extinction, wars, nuclear threat, poverty, famines, etc. Unfortunately, the current governance systems are generally unable to address these problems. They are often corrupted by economical interests and too slow. We strongly believe that only democracy can help humanity to avoid, as much as possible, these disasters. However, democracy is currently regressing in the world. To make it progress, we are developing a new technology that enables a worldwide governance system based on direct democracy. Designed around an open-source decentralized electronic voting mobile phone app, it allows anyone to propose referendums at municipal, regional, national or international levels for which everyone can vote anonymously, in a verifiable and non-censurable way. With this tool, humanity can decide freely, quickly and indisputably on the matters that concern it. The governments will have to choose their camp : either they apply the democratic decisions or they expose themselves to a popular uprising.<br><br>The goal of our association is to promote this democratic tool which aims at reversing the current trend of democratic decline and enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world for the greater good of humanity.",

    "q": "Q",
    "q1": "Is directdemocracy free?",
    "a1": "<p><em>Short answer:</em> <b>yes.</b></p><p>direct<b>democracy</b> is developed by a non-profit organization which has no commercial interest. Our developments and infrastructure are funded by foudations and donations from users. All the software involved in direct<b>democracy</b> is free and open-source. This is a guarantee that direct<b>democracy</b> will remain free forever.</p>",
    "q2": "I don't want to publish my name, ID picture and/or home location, can I still become a citizen?",
    "a2": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>maybe, but that's not recommended.</b></p><p>After registering as a citizen, your name, ID picture, and home location will be published online, in particular on the notary webservices. You may have good reasons for not willing to publish your name, ID picture and/or home location, including privacy concerns. However, direct<b>democracy</b> relies on a web of trust to assess if you really exist as a citizen and this information is needed by the other participants of the web of trust to actually trust you are a real citizen. It is always possible to use a fancy name, fuzzy ID picture and/or set your home location at the official building of the local administration of your village or city. In that case, when you ask your neighbors to endorse you, you will also have to explain to them why you didn't publish your real name, ID picture and/or home location. If your explanations are convincing, they may accept to endorse you and thus, you will be likely to get endorsed by a judge at some point. However, if you don't have good reasons, judges may decide to revoke your citizen card, if they have any doubt, thus preventing you from voting and signing.</p>",
    "q3": "My reputation is 0 and I cannot vote or sign, what shall I do?",
    "a3": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>get endorsed by your neighbors.</b></p><p>If you reputation is 0, this means that the judges of direct<b>democracy</b> do not consider you as a citizen. This is probably due to the fact that you just registered and were not yet endorsed by others. To fix it, you should meet your neighbors and ask them to endorse you. Explain to them about direct<b>democracy</b> and propose to them to install the app if not already done. Once they have installed the app, they should register as a citizen before they can endorse you. This should take a couple of minutes. Then, they will be able to endorse you from the app. In return, it is fair to also endorse them back. Each time you get endorsed by a neighbor, you should see your reputation increase. Whenever your reputation reaches 0.5, you will be considered as a citizen and be able to vote at referendums and sign petitions. You will need approximately 5 or 6 endorsements from neighbors to become a citizen. It is better to ask close neighbors because the endorsements of people living far away from you have less impact on your reputation.</p>",
    "q4": "What is the difference between a referendum and a petition?",
    "a4": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>referendums are anonymous answers to questions, petitions are public commitments.</b></p><p>In direct<b>democracy</b>, there are several differences between a petition and a referendum. Both are proposals aiming at a specific area, on which the citizens can express themselves. However, unlike a referendum, a petition has no question and no answers. Instead, the citizen shall simply sign the petition if they agree with it. Signing a petition is not anonymous, everyone can see the list of citizens who signed a petition. On the other hand a referendum is anonymous. Nobody can see the answer of a citizen to the question of a referendum. It is only possible to see how many selected each answer.</p>",
    "q5": "Can anyone see or change my answer to a referendum question?",
    "a5": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>no.</b></p><p>Your answer to the question of a referendum is fully anonymous and it should not be possible for anyone to see it. Basically, the ballot that you are casting is anonymous and was blindly signed by the direct<b>democracy</b> app after verifying that you are allowed to vote and before sending it to the polling station. The whole system was designed to guarantee all the necessary properties of a modern voting system, including anti-tampering and anonymity.</p>",
    "q6": "Is it possible to cheat, for example vote or sign more than once?",
    "a6": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>no.</b></p><p>The web of trust guarantees that each citizen has only one vote for each referendum, one signature for each petition.</p>",
    "q7": "I changed my mind on a referendum, can I change my vote?",
    "a7": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>yes, until the deadline.</b></p><p>During a referendum campaign, the debate should regularly bring new arguments allowing citizens to make their choice on what they will vote for. Even if they already voted, a citizen may change their mind and re-vote differently if the deadline of the referendum has not yet passed. Only their last vote will be taken into account. This allows citizens to change their mind during a referendum campaign, which we believe is fair and good for democracy.</p>",
    "q8": "What is the purpose of directdemocracy in countries already ruled by a direct democracy, like Switzerland?",
    "a8": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>a faster, cheaper democratic process.</b></p><p>In countries already ruled by a direct democracy, like Switzerland, the referendum is a very long process which requires gathering a large number of signatures, verifying these signatures, passing a number of administrative checks, setting a voting calendar, etc. before the citizens can actually vote on the referendum. The whole process typically lasts more than one year. That makes emergency decisions impossible to take by the people. For example during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency decisions were taken by the government regardless of the people's agreement. Democratic votations regarding these decisions came afterwards, which sounded wrong. With direct<b>democracy</b>, it is extremely fast to run a referendum and get results. The whole process could be reduced to one month or less in case of emergency.</p><p>Launching a referendum in a country ruled by a direct democracy like Switzerland is also a costly process mainly because you have to collect many paper signatures. Thus it is not easy for a citizen to launch a referendum. Once the signatures are collected, verified and you passed the administrative checks, you will have to launch a campaign with adverising posters, press releases, interviews, etc. Although the voting campaign costs are about the same with direct<b>democracy</b>, there is no need for a signature collection campaign. Therefore it saves a lot of costs and makes the first steps of launching a referendum much cheaper and more accessible to anyone. This constitutes a good point for democracy.</p>",
    "q9": "What is the main difference between directdemocracy and other e-voting systems?",
    "a9": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>citizens registration is fully decentralized.</b></p><p>In addition to featuring all the standard properties of e-voting systems (anonymous, tamper-proof, verifiable, open-source, etc.), direct<b>democracy</b> provides the missing building block of a fully decentralized voting system: the ability to issue citizen cards in a decentralized manner. This is an essential component to quickly enforce direct democracy in countries where governments refuse it, like in France for example where President Macron refused to introduce the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_initiative_referendum_(France)\" target=\"_blank\">RIC</a> on April 25th, 2019 as a response to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests\" target=\"_blank\">Yellow Vest Protest</a>.</p><p>Issuing trustable citizen cards allows the results of referendums and petition to be trustable as well. Therefore they can weight signficantly on polical decisions taken by governments. So, in addition to be a e-voting system, direct<b>democracy</b> also features the ability to enforce direct democracy even in countries where it is not accepted by the local authorities.</p>",
    "q10": "What is the web of trust?",
    "a10": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>a proof of the existance of unique citizens.</b></p><p>The web of trust is a decentralized system which is based on the fact that everyone knows everyone through others. If you know 1000 people and each of them knows 500 different people, who know 500 different people and so on. After seven iterations or so, you would be in touch with the whole population of the world. If you can personally assess that your neighbors are unique citizens and if all the citizens can do the same, then, you are building a web of trust.</p><p>This is what you will have to do in direct<b>democracy</b> with endorsements. In order to get recognized as a citizen, you should get endorsed by and endorse others citizens.</p>",
    "q11": "How can I propose a referendum (or a petition)?",
    "a11": "<p>To propose a referendum (or a petition), you should publish your proposal from a <a href=\"https://judge.directdemocracy.vote/propose.html\" target=\"_blank\">judge</a>. Your proposal should contain the following information:<p><ol><li><b>Area</b>: you should define which area your proposal is aiming at. It could be your village or city, your region, your country or the whole world. The area will set a geographical limit on who can vote. The subject of your proposal should concern only this area. In case the proposal is successful, it should be applied by the governing authorities of this area within their scope of responsibilities.</li><li><b>Title</b>: the title of your proposal should be short and capture the idea your are proposing, for example \"Safer streets in our village\"</li><li><b>Description</b>: the description text should provide all the necessary details about your proposal, including the description of the problem and the proposed solution with all the implementation details, including the budget. It could be a text of a regulation, a decision to build a specific infrastructure, etc.</li><li><b>Question</b>: (referendum only) the question asked to the citizens should be short and appeal to a clear answer, for example, \"Do you agree with this proposal to limit the speed of vehicles to 30 km/h in our village?\"</li><li><b>Answers</b>: (referendum only) the answers should include all the possible answers to the question, generally, \"yes\" and \"no\". Note that a \"blank\" answer is automatically added.</li><li><b>Website</b>: Optionally, you may want to set-up an official website to promote your proposal and provide more argumentation, possibly host a public debate, etc.</li><li><b>Deadline</b>: the deadline of your proposal sets a time limit at which the vote process will be stopped and the result will be published. It should leave enough time to allow the citizens to get informed about your proposal, possibly organize some debate, make a choice and finally vote. If you set it too short, the main risk is that your proposal will receive a low participation and hence its results won't be meaningful. We recommend a minimum of 3 months from the publication date for the deadline.</li></ol><p>Once your proposal is published, you are not done! You will need to promote it so that a maximum of citizens will vote at it and the results of the referendum will have a significant democratic weight. See next question.</p>",
    "q12": "How can I promote my referendum (or petition)?",
    "a12": "<p>Promoting a proposal will draw attention to it and increase the participation rate. Having a large participation in a referendum (or petition) is important as it will make it significant from a democratic point of view. Here are some ideas on how to promote your proposal:</p><ul><li>Spread the word about it around you.</li><li>Put up posters in the streets of your city, with the QR code of the proposal or website.</li><li>Publish newspaper articles.</li><li>Make a campaign on social networks.</li><li>Organize local presentations and debates.</li></ul><p>If you do a good job, your proposal will be successful, which means it will receive a large participation of the citizens in the proposal's area.</p>",
    "q13": "When shall we consider a referendum (or petition) successful?",
    "a13": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>when 25% of the population of the area participated.</b></p><p>The success of a referendum is determined by its participation rate. The participation rate in a specific area is defined by the number of citizens who voted (or signed) compared to the total number of citizens living in the area. It is expressed in percent. Depending on the area, the total number of citizens corresponds roughly to 70-80% of the total population after excluding the children. So, for a village in Switzerland, where the adult population is about 80% of the total population, we can consider that a village of 1000 people has roughly 800 citizens. In Switzerland, the participation level to referendums is usually around 30-40%. This means that for a village of 1000 inhabitants, about 280 (e.g., 1000 x 0.8 x 0.35) people usually participate, which represents 28% of the total population. We generally consider that when 25% of the population participates, this means that the whole population was aware of the referendum or petition and had a chance to express themselves about it.</p>",
    "q14": "Will the local authorities apply the result of my referendum (or petition)?",
    "a14": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>maybe.</b></p><p>It depends whether or not they respect democracy. Most local authorities or governments claim to be democratic. However, in practice they are not and they will probably either ignore the result of the referendum (or petition) or use a bureaucratic justification to reject it. If that happens, this will likely cause dissatisfaction among the people who expressed themselves and these people will likely increase the pressure on the authorities to enforce their democratic decision. This pressure may take several forms. It could increase the risk for the authorities of not being re-elected. But it may also cause demonstrations, riots, uprisings, revolutions. Globally, the pressure will endanger the power of the governing people who don't respect the democratic choice of their citizens.</p><p>In the long-term, we should see more and more local authorities and governments formally accepting any democratic choice of their citizens expressed through direct<b>democracy</b>.</p>",
    "q15": "Can I get more technical information about directdemocracy?",
    "a15": "<p>Sure, you will find our <a href=\"//github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/white_paper.md\">white paper</a> on our GitHub repository.</p>",
    "q16": "How can I help directdemocracy?",
    "a16": "<p>There are many ways you can help direct<b>democracy</b> to spread out to the world:</p><ul><li><b>Donate</b>: Any financial contribution will help us, we accept donations <a id=\"donate-link\" href=\"#donate\">here</a>.</li> <li><b>Communicate</b>: spread the word about direct<b>democracy</b> around you.</li> <li><b>Document</b>: review and contribute to our documentation, including our <a href=\"https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.

    "q17": "Why is the app only available on smartphone and tablets?",
    "a17": "<p>This is because the app needs to assess its authenticity to prevent people from cheating with a modified app. App authenticity checking features are currently only offered by the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity target=\"_blank\">Android Play Integrity</a> and the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck\" target=\"_blank\">Apple iOS DeviceCheck</a> on mobile apps.</p>"
