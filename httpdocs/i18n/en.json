    "about-text": "The <em>DirectDemocracy Association</em> is a non-profit association based in Switzerland which promotes the <em>directdemocracy</em> electronic voting system to enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.",
    "motivation": "<b>Our Motivation:</b> Humanity is facing increasingly challenging threats: global warming, mass extinction, wars, nuclear threat, poverty, famines, etc. Unfortunately, the current governance systems are generally unable to address these problems. They are often corrupted by economical interests and too slow. We strongly believe that only democracy can help humanity to avoid, as much as possible, these disasters. However, democracy is currently regressing in the world. To make it progress, we are developing a new technology that enables a worldwide governance system based on direct democracy. Designed around an open-source decentralized electronic voting mobile phone app, it allows anyone to propose referendums at municipal, regional, national or international levels for which everyone can vote anonymously, in a verifiable and non-censurable way. With this tool, humanity can decide freely, quickly and indisputably on the matters that concern it. The governments will have to choose their camp : either they apply the democratic decisions or they expose themselves to a popular uprising.<br><br>The goal of our association is to promote this democratic tool which aims at reversing the current trend of democratic decline and enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world for the greater good of humanity.",

    "q": "Q",
    "q1": "Is directdemocracy free?",
    "a1": "<p><em>Short answer:</em> <b>yes.</b></p><p>direct<b>democracy</b> is developed by a non-profit organization which has no commercial interest. Our developments and infrastructure are funded by foudations and donations from users. All the software involved in direct<b>democracy</b> is free and open-source. This is a guarantee that direct<b>democracy</b> will remain free forever.</p>",
    "q2": "I don't want to publish my name, ID picture and/or home location, can I still become a citizen?",
    "a2": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>maybe, but that's not recommended.</b></p><p>After registering as a citizen, your name, ID picture, and home location will be published online, in particular on the notary webservices. You may have good reasons for not willing to publish your name, ID picture and/or home location, including privacy concerns. However, direct<b>democracy</b> relies on a web of trust to assess you really exist as a citizen and this information is needed by the other participants of the web of trust to actually trust you are a real citizen. It is always possible to use a fancy name, fuzzy ID picture and/or set your home location at the official building of the local administration of your village or city. In that case, when you will ask your neighbors to endorse you, you will also have to explain them why you didn't publish your real name, ID picture and/or home location. If you explanations are convincing, they may accept to endorse you and thus, you will be likely to get endorsed by a judge at some point. However, if you don't have good reasons, judges may decide to revoke your citizen card, if they have any doubt, thus preventing you from voting and signing.</p>",
    "q3": "My reputation is 0 and I cannot vote or sign, what shall I do?",
    "a3": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>get endorsed by your neighbors.</b></p><p>If you reputation is 0, this means that the judges of direct<b>democracy</b> do not consider you as a citizen. This is probably due to the fact that you just registered and were not yet endorsed by others. To fix it, you should meet your neighbors and ask them to endorse you. Explain them about direct<b>democracy</b> and propose them to install the app if not already done. Once they have installed the app, they should register as a citizen before they can endorse you. This should take a couple of minutes. Then, they will be able to endorse you from the app. In return, it is fair to also endorse them back. Each time you get endorsed by a neighbor, you should see your reputation increase. Whenever your reputation reaches 0.5, you will be considered as a citizen and be able to vote at referendums and sign petitions. You will need approximately 5 or 6 endorsements from neighbors to become a citizen. It is better to ask close neighbors because the endorsements of people living far away from you have less impact on your reputation.</p>",
    "q4": "What is the difference between a referendum and a petition?",
    "a4": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>referendums are anonymous answers to questions, petitions are public commitments.</b></p><p>In direct<b>democracy</b>, there are several differences between a petition and a referendum. Both are proposals aiming a specific area, on which the citizens can express themselves. However, unlike a referendum, a petition has no question and no answers. Instead, the citizen shall simply sign the petition if they agree with it. Signing a petition is not anonymous, everyone can see the list of citizens who signed a petition. On the other hand a referendum is anonymous. Nobody can see the answer of a citizen to the question of a referendum. It is only possible to see how many selected each answer.</p>",
    "q5": "Can anyone see or change my answer to a referendum question?",
    "a5": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>no.</b></p><p>Your answer to the question of a referendum is fully anonymous and it should not be possible for anyone to see it. Basically, the ballot that you are casting is anonymous and was blindly signed by the direct<b>democracy</b> app after verifying that you are allowed to vote and before sending it to the polling station. The whole system was designed to guarantee all the necessary properties of a modern voting systems, including anti-tampering and anonymity.</p>",
    "q6": "Is it possible to cheat, for example vote or sign more than once?",
    "a6": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>no.</b></p><p>The web of trust guarantees that each citizen has only one vote for each referendum, one signature for each petition.</p>",
    "q7": "I changed my mind on a referendum, can I change my vote?",
    "a7": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>yes, until the deadline.</b></p><p>During a referendum campaign, the debate should bring regularly new arguments allowing citizens to make their choice on what they will vote. Even if they already voted, a citizen may change their mind and re-vote differently if the deadline of the referendum has not yet passed. Only their last vote will be taken into account. This allows citizens to change their mind during a referendum campaign, which we believe is fair and good for democracy.</p>",
    "q8": "What is the purpose of directdemocracy in countries already ruled by a direct democracy, like Switzerland?",
    "a8": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>a faster, cheaper democratic process.</b></p><p>In countries already ruled by a direct democracy, like Switzerland, the referendum is a very long process which requires gathering a large number of signatures, verifying these signatures, passing a number of administrative checks, setting a voting calendar, etc. before the citizens can actually vote on the referendum. The whole process typically lasts more than one year. That makes emergency decisions impossible to take by the people. For example during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency decisions were taken by the government regardless of the people's agreement. Democratic votations regarding these decisions came afterwards, which is sounded wrong. With direct<b>democracy</b>, it is extremely fast to run a referendum and get results. The whole process could be reduced to one month or less in case of emergency.</p><p>Launching a referendum in a country ruled by a direct democracy like Switzerland is also a costly process mainly because you have to collect many paper signatures. Thus it is not easy for a citizen to launch a referendum. Once the signatures are collected, verified and you passed the administrative checks, you will have to launch a campaign with adverising posters, press releases, interviews, etc. Although the voting campaign costs are about the same with direct<b>democracy</b>, there is no need for a signature collection campaign. Therefore it saves a lot of costs and makes the first steps of launching a referendum much cheaper and more accessible to anyone. This constitutes a good point for democracy.</p>",
    "q9": "What is the main difference between directdemocracy and other e-voting systems?",
    "a9": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>citizens registration is fully decentralized.</b></p><p>In addition to featuring all the standard properties of e-voting systems (anonymous, tamper-proof, verifiable, open-source, etc.), direct<b>democracy</b> provides the missing building block of a fully decentralized voting system: the ability to issue citizen cards in a decentralized manner. This is an essential component to quickly enforce direct democracy in countries where governments refuse it, like in France for example where President Macron refused to introduce the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_initiative_referendum_(France)\" target=\"_blank\">RIC</a> on April 25th, 2019 as a response to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests\" target=\"_blank\">Yellow Vest Protest</a>.</p><p>Issuing trustable citizen cards allows the results of referendums and petition to be trustable as well. Therefore they can weight signficantly on polical decisions taken by governments. So, in addition to be a e-voting system, direct<b>democracy</b> also features the ability to enforce direct democracy even in countries where it is not accepted by the local authorities.</p>",
    "q10": "What is the web of trust?",
    "a10": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>a proof of the existance of unique citizens.</b></p><p>The web of trust is a decentralized system which is based on the fact that everyone knows everyone through others. If you know 1000 people and each of them know 500 different people, who know 500 different people and so on. After seven iterations or so, you would be in touch with the whole population of the world. If you can personnaly assess that your neighbors are unique citizens and if all the citizens can do the same, then, you are building a web of trust.</p><p>This is what you will have to do in direct<b>democracy</b> with endorsements. In order to get recognized as a citizen, you should get endorsed by and endorse others citizens.</p>",
