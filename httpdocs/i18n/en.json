    "about-text": "The <em>DirectDemocracy Association</em> is a non-profit association based in Switzerland which promotes the <em>directdemocracy</em> electronic voting system to enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.",
    "motivation": "<b>Our Motivation:</b> Humanity is facing increasingly challenging threats: global warming, mass extinction, wars, nuclear threat, poverty, famines, etc. Unfortunately, the current governance systems are generally unable to address these problems. They are often corrupted by economical interests and too slow. We strongly believe that only democracy can help humanity to avoid, as much as possible, these disasters. However, democracy is currently regressing in the world. To make it progress, we are developing a new technology that enables a worldwide governance system based on direct democracy. Designed around an open-source decentralized electronic voting mobile phone app, it allows anyone to propose referendums at municipal, regional, national or international levels for which everyone can vote anonymously, in a verifiable and non-censurable way. With this tool, humanity can decide freely, quickly and indisputably on the matters that concern it. The governments will have to choose their camp : either they apply the democratic decisions or they expose themselves to a popular uprising.<br><br>The goal of our association is to promote this democratic tool which aims at reversing the current trend of democratic decline and enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world for the greater good of humanity.",
