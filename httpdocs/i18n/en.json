    "about-text": "The <em>DirectDemocracy Association</em> is a non-profit association based in Switzerland which promotes the <em>directdemocracy</em> electronic voting system to enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.",
    "motivation": "<b>Our Motivation:</b> Humanity is facing increasingly challenging threats: global warming, mass extinction, wars, nuclear threat, poverty, famines, etc. Unfortunately, the current governance systems are generally unable to address these problems. They are often corrupted by economical interests and too slow. We strongly believe that only democracy can help humanity to avoid, as much as possible, these disasters. However, democracy is currently regressing in the world. To make it progress, we are developing a new technology that enables a worldwide governance system based on direct democracy. Designed around an open-source decentralized electronic voting mobile phone app, it allows anyone to propose referendums at municipal, regional, national or international levels for which everyone can vote anonymously, in a verifiable and non-censurable way. With this tool, humanity can decide freely, quickly and indisputably on the matters that concern it. The governments will have to choose their camp : either they apply the democratic decisions or they expose themselves to a popular uprising.<br><br>The goal of our association is to promote this democratic tool which aims at reversing the current trend of democratic decline and enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world for the greater good of humanity.",

    "q": "Q",
    "q1": "Is directdemocracy free?",
    "a1": "<p><em>Short answer:</em> <b>yes.</b></p><p>direct<b>democracy</b> is developed by a non-profit organization which has no commercial interest. Our developments and infrastructure are funded by foudations and donations from users. All the software involved in direct<b>democracy</b> is free and open-source. This is a guarantee that direct<b>democracy</b> will remain free forever.</p>",
    "q2": "I don't want to publish my name, ID picture and/or home location, can I still become a citizen?"
    "a2": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>maybe, but that's not recommended.</b></p><p>After registering as a citizen, your name, ID picture, and home location will be published online, in particular on the notary webservices. You may have good reasons for not willing to publish your name, ID picture and/or home location, including privacy concerns. However, direct<b>democracy</b> relies on a web of trust to assess you really exist as a citizen and this information is needed by the other participants of the web of trust to actually trust you are a real citizen. It is always possible to use a fancy name, fuzzy ID picture and/or set your home location at the official building of the local administration of your village or city. In that case, when you will ask your neighbors to endorse you, you will also have to explain them why you didn't publish your real name, ID picture and/or home location. If you explanations are convincing, they may accept to endorse you and thus, you will be likely to get endorsed by a judge at some point. However, if you don't have good reasons, judges may decide to revoke your citizen card, if they have any doubt, thus preventing you from voting and signing.</p>",
    "q3": "My reputation is 0 and I cannot vote or sign, what shall I do?",
    "a3": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>get endorsed by your neighbors.</b></p><p>If you reputation is 0, this means that the judges of direct<b>democracy</b> do not consider you as a citizen. This is probably due to the fact that you just registered and were not yet endorsed by others. To fix it, you should meet your neighbors and ask them to endorse you. Explain them about direct<b>democracy</b> and propose them to install the app if not already done. Once they have installed the app, they should register as a citizen before they can endorse you. This should take a couple of minutes. Then, they will be able to endorse you from the app. In return, it is fair to also endorse them back. Each time you get endorsed by a neighbor, you should see your reputation increase. Whenever your reputation reaches 0.5, you will be considered as a citizen and be able to vote at referendums and sign petitions. You will need approximately 5 or 6 endorsements from neighbors to become a citizen. It is better to ask close neighbors because the endorsements of people living far away from you have less impact on your reputation.</p>",
    "q4": "What is the difference between a referendum and a petition?",
    "a4": "<p><em>Short answer</em>: <b>referendums are anonymous answers to questions, petitions are public commitments.</b></p><p>In direct<b>democracy</b>, there are several differences between a petition and a referendum. Both are proposals aiming a specific area, on which the citizens can express themselves. However, unlike a referendum, a petition has no question and no answers. Instead, the citizen shall simply sign the petition if they agree with it. Signing a petition is not anonymous, everyone can see the list of citizens who signed a petition. On the other hand a referendum is anonymous. Nobody can see the answer of a citizen to the question of a referendum. It is only possible to see how many selected each answer.</p>"
