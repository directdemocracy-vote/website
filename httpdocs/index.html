            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>This initiative aims at establishing world-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy" target="_blank">direct democracy</a> in order to bring peace, safety and prosperity to humananity, including saving the climate
              and the biodiversity. The principle is that people will become citizens by proposing referundums and voting regardless of any official acknowledgement. Vote results from a limited number of citizens could be considered as simple survey
              results. They could feed debates, influence political decisions and foster more people to become citizens. Vote results from areas where a majority of people are citizens will become significant from a democratic point of view. This
              will increase the pressure on governments to respect the democratic choices expressed by their people. Ultimately, this bottom-up initiative will enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>The proposed system implements the following necessary features:</p>

              <li>supported by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust" target="_blank">web of trust</a>: distributed reputation system.</li>
              <li>verifiable: check that my vote was taken into account, check that others didn't cheat.</li>
              <li>robust to attacks, resistant to censorship.</li>
              <li>relying on state-of-the-art <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography" target="_blank">cryptography</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">free and open-source</a>
