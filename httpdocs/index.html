                  The <em>DirectDemocracy Association</em> is a non-profit association based in Switzerland which
                  promotes
                  the
                  <em>DirectDemocracy</em> electronic voting system to enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                  <b>Our Motivation:</b>
                  Humanity is facing increasingly challenging threats : global warming, mass extinction, wars, nuclear
                  threat, poverty, famines, etc. Unfortunately, the current governance systems are generally unable to address
                  these problems. They are often corrupted by economical interests and too slow. We strongly believe that only
                  democracy can help humanity to avoid, as much as possible, these disasters. However, democracy is currently
                  regressing in the world. To make it progress, we are developing a new technology that enables a worldwide
                  governance system based on direct democracy. Designed around an open-source decentralized electronic voting
                  mobile phone app, it allows anyone to propose referendums at municipal, regional, national or international
                  levels for which everyone can vote anonymously, in a verifiable and non-censurable way. With this tool,
                  humanity can decide freely, quickly and indisputably on the matters that concern it. The governments will
                  have to choose their camp : either they apply the democratic decisions or they expose themselves to a
                  popular uprising.

                  The goal of our association is to promote this democratic tool which aims at reversing the current trend of
                  democratic decline and enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world for the greater good of humanity.

                After registering as a citizen, your name, ID picture, and home location will be published online, in particular on the notary webservices.
                You may have good reasons for not willing to publish your name, ID picture and/or home location, including privacy concerns.
                However, direct<b>democracy</b> relies on a web of trust to assess you really exist as a citizen and this information is needed
                by the other participants of the web of trust to actually trust you are a real citizen.
                It is always possible to use a fancy name, fuzzy ID picture and/or set your home location at the official building of the local administration of your village or city.
                In that case, when you will ask your neighbors to endorse you, you will also have to explain them why you didn't publish your real name, ID picture and/or home location.
                If you explanations are convincing, they may accept to endorse you and thus, you will be likely to get endorsed by a judge at some point.
                However, if you don't have good reasons, judges may decide to revoke your citizen card, if they have any doubt, thus preventing you from voting and signing.

              </p>
              <p>
                If you reputation is 0, this means that the judges of direct<b>democracy</b> do not consider you as a
                citizen. This is probably due to the fact that you just registered and were not yet endorsed by others.
                To fix it, you should meet your neighbors and ask them to endorse you. Explain them about
                direct<b>democracy</b> and propose them to install the app if not already done. Once they have installed
                the app, they should register as a citizen before they can endorse you. This should take a couple of
                minutes. Then, they will be able to endorse you from the app. In return, it is fair to also endorse them
                back. Each time you get endorsed by a neighbor, you should see your reputation increase. Whenever your
                reputation reaches 0.5, you will be considered as a citizen and be able to vote at referendums and sign
                petitions. You will need approximately 5 or 6 endorsements from neighbors to become a citizen. It is
                better to ask close neighbors because the endorsements of people living far away from you have less
                impact on your reputation.

              </p>
              <p>
                In direct<b>democracy</b>, there are several differences between a petition and a referendum. Both are
                proposals aiming a specific area, on which the citizens can express themselves. However, unlike a
                referendum, a petition has no question and no answers. Instead, the citizen shall simply sign the
                petition if they agree with it. Signing a petition is not anonymous, everyone can see the list of
                citizens who signed a petition. On the other hand a referendum is anonymous. Nobody can see the answer
                of a citizen to the question of a referendum. It is only possible to see how many selected each
                answer.

              <p>
                Your answer to the question of a referendum is fully anonymous and it should not be possible for anyone
                to see it. Basically, the ballot that you are casting is anonymous and was blindly signed by the
                direct<b>democracy</b> app after verifying that you are allowed to vote and before sending it to the
                polling station. The whole system was designed to guarantee all the necessary properties of a modern
                voting systems, including anti-tampering and anonymity.

                During a referendum campaign, the debate should bring regularly new arguments allowing citizens to
                make their choice on what they will vote. Even if they already voted, a citizen may change their mind
                and re-vote differently if the deadline of the referendum has not yet passed. Only their last vote
                will be taken into account. This allows citizens to change their mind during a referendum campaign,
                which we believe is fair and good for democracy.

                <em>Short answer</em>: <b>a faster, cheaper democratic process.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                In countries already ruled by a direct democracy, like Switzerland, the referendum is a very long process which requires gathering a large number of signatures,
                verifying these signatures, passing a number of administrative checks, setting a voting calendar, etc. before the citizens can actually vote on the referendum.
                The whole process typically lasts more than one year. That makes emergency decisions impossible to take by the people. For example during the COVID-19 pandemic,
                emergency decisions were taken by the government regardless of the people's agreement. Democratic votations regarding these decisions came afterwards, which is
                sounded wrong. With direct<b>democracy</b>, it is extremely fast to run a referendum and get results. The whole process could be reduced to one month or less in
                case of emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Launching a referendum in a country ruled by a direct democracy like Switzerland is also a costly process mainly because you have to collect many paper
                signatures. Thus it is not easy for a citizen to launch a referendum. Once the signatures are collected, verified and you passed the administrative checks,
                you will have to launch a campaign with adverising posters, press releases, interviews, etc. Although the voting campaign costs are about the same with
                direct<b>democracy</b>, there is no need for a signature collection campaign. Therefore it saves a lot of costs and makes the first steps of launching a
                referendum much cheaper and more accessible to anyone. This constitutes a good point for democracy.

                <em>Short answer</em>: <b>citizens registration is fully decentralized.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to featuring all the standard properties of e-voting systems (anonymous, tamper-proof,
                verifiable, open-source, etc.), direct<b>democracy</b> provides the missing building block of a fully
                decentralized voting system: the ability to issue citizen cards in a decentralized manner.
                This is an essential component to quickly enforce direct democracy in countries where governments
                refuse it, like in France for example where President Macron refused to introduce the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_initiative_referendum_(France)" target="_blank">RIC</a>
                on April 25th, 2019 as a response to the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests" target="_blank">Yellow Vest Protest</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Issuing trustable citizen cards allows the results of referendums and petition to be trustable as well.
                Therefore they can weight signficantly on polical decisions taken by governments.
                So, in addition to be a e-voting system, direct<b>democracy</b> also features the ability to enforce
                direct democracy even in countries where it is not accepted by the local authorities.

                The web of trust is a decentralized system which is based on the fact that everyone knows everyone

                different people and so on. After seven iterations or so, you would be in touch with the whole
                population of the world. If you can personnaly assess that your neighbors are unique citizens and if
                all the citizens can do the same, then, you are building a web of trust.

                <a href="https://judge.directdemocracy.vote/propose.html" target="_blank">judge</a>.
                Your proposal should contain the following information:
              <p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Area</b>:
                  you should define to which area your proposal is aiming at. It could be your village or city, your
                  region, your country or the whole world. The area will set a geographical limit on who can vote. The
                  subject of your proposal should concern only this area. In case the proposal is successful, it should
                  be applied by the governing authorities of this area within their scope of responsibilities.</li>
                <li><b>Title</b>:
                  the title of your proposal should be short and capture the idea your are proposing, for example "Safer
                  streets in our village"</li>
                <li><b>Description</b>:
                  the description text should provide all the necessary details about your proposal, including the
                  description of the problem and the proposed solution with all the implementation details, including
                  the budget. It could be a text of a regulation, a decision to build a specific infrastructure, etc.
                </li>
                <li><b>Question</b>: (referendum only)
                  the question asked to the citizen should be short and ask appeal a clear answer, for example, "Do you
                  agree with this proposal to limit the speed of vehicles to 30 km/h in our village?"
                </li>
                <li><b>Answers</b>: (referendum only)
                  the answers should include all the possible answers to the question, generally, "yes" and "no". Note
                  that an "abstain" answer is automatically added.</li>
                <li><b>Website</b>:
                  Optionally, you may want to set-up an official website to promote your proposal and provide more
                  argumentation, possibly host a public debate, etc.
                </li>
                <li><b>Deadline</b>:
                  the deadline of your proposal sets a time limit at which the vote process will be stopped and the
                  result will be published. It should leave enough time to allow the citizens to get informed about your
                  proposal, possibly organize some debate, make a choice and finally vote. If you set it too short, the
                  main risk is that your proposal will receive a low participation and hence its results won't be
                  meaningful. We recommend a minimum of 3 months from the publication date for the deadline.

              <p>Once your proposal is published, you are not done! You will needed to promote it so that a maximum of

                Promoting a proposal will draw attention to it and increase the participation rate. Having a large
                participation to a referendum (or petition) is important as it will make it significant from a

                <em>Short answer</em>: <b>when 25% of the population of the area participated.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The success of a referendum is determined by its participation rate. The participation rate in a
                specific area is defined by the number of citizens who voted (or signed) compared to the total number of
                citizen living in the area. It is expressed in percent. Depending on the area, the total number of
                citizens corresponds roughly to 70-80% of the total population after excluding the children. So, for a
                village in Switzerland, where the adult population is about 80% of the total population, we can consider
                that a village of 1000 people has roughly 800 citizens. In Switzerland, the participation level to
                referendums usually around 30-40%. This means that for a village of 1000 inhabitants, about 280 (e.g.,
                1000 x 0.8 x 0.35) people usually participate, which represents 28% of the total population. We
                generally consider that when 25% of the population participates, this means that the whole population
                was aware of the referendum or petition and had a chance to express themselves about it.

                It depends whether or not they respect democracy. Most local authorities or governments claim to be
                democratic. However, in practice they are not and they will probably either ignore the result of the
                referendum (or petition) or use a bureaucratic justification to reject it. If that happens, this will
                likely cause dissatisfaction among the people who expressed themselves and these people will likely
                increase the pressure on the authorities to enforce their democratic decision. This pressure may take
                several forms. It could increase risk for the authorities of not being re-elected. But it may also cause
                demonstrations, riots, uprisings, revolutions. Globally, the pressure will endanger the power of the
                governing people who don't respect the democratic choice of their citizens.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the long-term, we should see more and more local authorities and governments formally accepting any
                democratic choice of their citizens expressed through direct<b>democracy</b>.
