                  The <em>DirectDemocracy Association</em> is a non-profit association based in Switzerland which
                  promotes
                  the
                  <em>DirectDemocracy</em> electronic voting system to enforce direct democracy everywhere in the world.

                <p class="mt-4">
                  <b>Our Motivation:</b>
                  Humanity is facing increasingly challenging threats : global warming, mass extinction, wars, nuclear
                  threat, poverty, famines, etc. Unfortunately, the current governance systems are unable to address
                  these
                  problems. They are corrupted by economical interests and too slow. We strongly believe that only
                  democracy can help humanity to avoid, as much as possible, these disasters. However, democracy is
                  currently regressing in the world. But we have developed a unique technology that can enforce a
                  worldwide governance system based on direct democracy. Designed around an open-source decentralized
                  electronic voting mobile phone app, it allows anyone to propose referendums at municipal, regional,
                  national or international levels for which everyone can vote anonymously, in a verifiable and
                  non-censurable way. With this tool, humanity can decide freely, quickly and indisputably on the
                  matters
                  that concern it. The governments will have to choose their camp : either they apply the democratic
                  decisions or they expose themselves to a popular uprising. The goal of our association is to promote
                  this democratic tool which aims at reversing the current trend of democratic decline and enforce
                  direct democracy everywhere in the world for the greater good of humanity.

                If you reputation is 0, this means that the judges of direct<b>democracy</b>do not consider you as a
                citizen. This is probably due to the fact that you were not yet endorsed by others. To fix it, you
                should meet with your neighbours and ask them to endorse you. Each time you get endorsed by a neighbour,
                you should see your reputation increase. Whenever it reaches 0.5, you will be considered as a citizen
                and be able to vote at referendums and sign petitions.

                You will need to be endorsed by several people, generally 5 or so, preferably your neighbours, to be
                recognized as a citizen. To get endorsed, simply meet your neighboor, explain them about
                direct<b>democracy</b> and ask them to install the app if not already done. Once they have installed the
                app, they should register as a citizen before they can endorse you. This should take a couple of
                minutes.
                Then, they will be able to endorse you from the app. In return, it is fair to also endorse them back, so
                that they will get their first endorsement from you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right after you get endorsed, you should see your reputation increase. Whenever, it reaches 0.5 you will
                be considered as a citizen and be able to vote at referendums and sign petitions.

                In direct<b>democracy</b>, there are several differences between a petition and a referendum. Both are
                proposals aiming a specific area, on which the citizens can express themselves. However, unlike a
                referendum, a petition has no question and no answers. Instead, the citizen shall simply sign the
                petition if they agree with it. Signing a petition is not anonymous, everyone can see the list of
                citizens who signed a petition. On the other hand a referendum is anonymous. Nobody can see the answer
                of a citizen to the question of a referendum. It is only possible to see how many selected each
                answer.

                No. Your answer to the question of a referendum is fully anonymous and it should not be possible for
                anyone to see it. Basically, the ballot that you are casting is anonymous and was blindly signed by the
                direct<b>democracy</b> app after verifying that you are allowed to vote and before sending it to the
                polling station. The whole system was designed to guarantee all the necessary properties of a modern
                voting systems, including anti-tampering and anonymity.

                No. The web of trust guarantees that each citizen has only one vote for each referendum, one signature

                The web of trust is a decentralized system which is based on the fact that everyone knows everyone
                through others. If you know 1000 people and each of them know 500 different people, who know 500
                different people and so on. After seven iterations or so, you would be in touch with the whole
                population of the world. If you can personnaly assess that your neighbours are unique citizens and if
                all the citizens can do the same, then, you are building a web of trust.

              <p>
                To propose a referendum (or a petition), you should publish your proposal from a
                <a href="https://judge.directdemocracy.vote/propose.html" target="_blank">judge</a>.
                Your proposal should contain the following information:
              <p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Area</b>:
                  you should define to which area your proposal is aiming at. It could be your village or city, your
                  region, your country or the whole world. The area will set a geographical limit on who can vote. The
                  subject of your proposal should concern only this area. In case the proposal is successful, it should
                  be applied by the governing authorities of this area within their scope of responsibilities.</li>
                <li><b>Title</b>:
                  the title of your proposal should be short and capture the idea your are proposing, for example "Safer
                  streets in our village"</li>
                <li><b>Description</b>:
                  the description text should provide all the necessary details about your proposal, including the
                  description of the problem and the proposed solution with all the implementation details, including
                  the budget. It could be a text of a regulation, a decision to build a specific infrastructure, etc.
                </li>
                <li><b>Question</b>: (referendum only)
                  the question asked to the citizen should be short and ask appeal a clear answer, for example, "Do you
                  agree with this proposal to limit the speed of vehicles to 30 km/h in our village?"
                </li>
                <li><b>Answers</b>: (referendum only)
                  the answers should include all the possible answers to the question, generally, "yes" and "no". Note
                  that an "abstain" answer is automatically added.</li>
                <li><b>Website</b>:
                  Optionally, you may want to set-up an official website to promote your proposal and provide more
                  argumentation, possibly host a public debate, etc.
                </li>
                <li><b>Deadline</b>:
                  the deadline of your proposal sets a time limit at which the vote process will be stopped and the
                  result will be published. It should leave enough time to allow the citizens to get informed about your
                  proposal, possibly organize some debate, make a choice and finally vote. If you set it too short, the
                  main risk is that your proposal will receive a low participation and hence its results won't be
                  meaningful. We recommend a minimum of 3 months from the publication date for the deadline.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Once your proposal is published, you are not done! You will needed to promote it so that a maximum of
                citizens will vote at it and the results of the refendum will have a significant democratic weight.

                Promoting a proposal will draw attention to it and increase the participation rate. Having a large
                participation to a referendum (or petition) is important as it will make it significant from a
                democratic point of view. Here are some ideas on how to promote your proposal:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Spread the word about it around you.</li>
                <li>Put up posters in the streets of your city, with the QR code of the proposal or website.</li>
                <li>Publish newspapers articles.</li>
                <li>Make a campaign on the social networks.</li>
                <li>Organize local presentations and debates.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you do a good job, your proposal will be successful, which means it will receive a large
                participation of the citizens in the proposal's area.

                The short answer is when 25% of the population of the area participated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The success of a referendum is determined by its participation rate. The participation rate in a
                specific area is defined by the number of citizens who voted (or signed) compared to the total number of
                citizen living in the area. It is expressed in percent. Depending on the area, the total number of
                citizens corresponds roughly to 70-80% of the total population after excluding the children. So, for a
                village in Switzerland, where the adult population is about 80% of the total population, we can consider
                that a village of 1000 people has roughly 800 citizens. In Switzerland, the participation level to
                referendums usually around 30-40%. This means that for a village of 1000 inhabitants, about 280 (e.g.,
                1000 x 0.8 x 0.35) people usually participate, which represents 28% of the total population. We
                generally consider that when 25% of the population participates, this means that the whole population
                was aware of the referendum or petition and had a chance to express themselves about it.

                It depends whether or not they respect democracy. Most local authorities or governments claim to be
                democratic. However, in practice they are not and they will probably either ignore the result of the
                referendum (or petition) or use a bureaucratic justification to reject it. If that happens, this will
                likely cause dissatisfaction among the people who expressed themselves and these people will likely
                increase the pressure on the authorities to enforce their democratic decision. This pressure may take
                several forms. It could increase risk for the authorities of not being re-elected. But it may also cause
                demonstrations, riots, uprisings, revolutions. Globally, the pressure will endanger the power of the
                governing people who don't respect the democratic choice of their citizens.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the long-term, we should see more and more local authorities and governments formally accepting any
                democratic choice of their citizens expressed through direct<b>democracy</b>.
