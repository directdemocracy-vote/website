# English beta test campaign

This page explains how to test the DirectDemocracy app as a beta tester.

**Note**: all the data you may provide during this beta test can be deleted at any time.

## Test

To become a DirectDemocracy beta tester, follow the steps below:

1. Install the [DirectDemocracy app](https://app.directdemocracy.vote) on your cell phone (iOS or Android)
   - Android: download the [APK](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/app/releases/download/2.0.54/directdemocracy-2.0.54.apk) file from the app's [release page](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/app/releases) and run it to install.
   - iOS: not yet available.
3. Create a fake citizen card
   - Pretend you're using the DirectDemocracy app for the first time (even if you're not).
   - Make sure the language selected in the Settings is English. If not, select English.
   - Enter your real or fictitious first and last name(s).
   - Provide your real ID photo or am ID photo that is not you.
   - **Important**: Set your home in the ghost village of [Bodie](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/details.html?osmtype=R&osmid=227078&class=boundary). By default, the beta app has the GPS position deactivated and will position you in Bodie if your language is English, as defined in Settings (and in Le Poil, France if your language is set to French).
4. Get endorsed in by others beta citizens of Bodie
   - Search for your neighbors in the [notary's register](https://notary.directdemocracy.vote?latitude=38.2115&longitude=-119.0126).
   - Contact these neighbors on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/discussions/categories/endorsements).
   - Endorse your neighbors, who will probably endorse you in return.
   - Repeat the operation with other neighbors until your reputation exceeds 50%. It usually takes 3 or 4 endorsements to be trusted by a judge, who will award you a reputation of over 50%.
5. Vote in a referendum or sign a petition
   - Search for a referendum or petition you're interested in at Bodie in the [registre du notaire](https://notary.directdemocracy.vote?tab=proposals&latitude=38.2115&longitude=-119.0126) or on GitHub Discussions ([referendums](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/discussions/categories/referendums-english) and [petitions](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/discussions/categories/petitions-english)).
   - Click on the Vote button on the referendum page (or on the Sign button for a petition) and follow the procedure.
   - Observe the results.
6. Propose a referendum or petition at Bodie
   - Write and [publish](https://judge.directdemocracy.vote/propose.html?latitude=38.2115&longitude=-119.0126) your proposal.
   - Advertise your referendum or petition on GitHub Discussions ([referendums](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/discussions/categories/referendums-english) and [petitions](https://github.com/directdemocracy-vote/www/discussions/categories/petitions-english) and/or any other means of communication.
   - Vote in your own referendum or sign your petition.
   - Observe the results.

## Why Bodie?

[Bodie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodie,_California) is one of the largest ghost town in the world. No one lives there any more. By creating citizen located in Bodie, we know they actually don't exist and they are just beta testers. So, we can feel safe to delete them at the end (or during) the beta test program.
